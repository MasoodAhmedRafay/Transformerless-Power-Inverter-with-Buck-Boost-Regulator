# Transformerless-Power-Inverter-with-Buck-Boost-Regulator
Senior Design Project in my Bachelors in Electronics

The aim of our project is to provide constant High Voltage DC supply required to run huge machinery in industries. Generating electricity using solar energy is cheap and renewable and highly efficient. This whole system requires just a one-time setup then it provides output continuously and requires no extra investment other than maintenance over the years which is not too costly either compared to the output. Nowadays, producing and providing electricity is a major problem and there is always a risk of breakdown even after that. In huge industries, losing electricity for even a few minutes means a loss of millions of Rupees and this is where Solar energy can prove beneficial. By setting up this system, we can have an alternate energy source in case of a breakdown and this system is more than efficient enough to run for hours, provided the conditions are met.
